# Kotlin Window Management library

Kotlin Window Management is a library that wraps OS-specific window management APIs into an idiomatic Kotlin interface.

The library serves as a foundation for the UI framework used in [Air](https://air.dev/) and will later provide
an OS integration layer for Compose for Desktop.

## Goals
* Provide a simple Kotlin API for OS features needed to build desktop applications
* Support all major desktop platforms: Linux (both X11 and Wayland), macOS and Windows
* Flatten OS quirks or at least document them
* Provide a safe API. Incorrect usage of the API should lead to Kotlin exceptions but not crashes
* Provide rendering contexts compatible with Skia, e.g., via [skiko](https://github.com/jetbrains/skiko)
* Make it Kotlin Multiplatform in the future

## Non-Goals
* Providing bindings for Android or iOS, they are too different from desktop
* Bindings for browser APIs
* API alignment across platforms. Desktop platforms differ in their capabilities; we do not intend to hide these differences
